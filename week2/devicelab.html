	<h1>Open Device Lab</h1>
	<p>A recent introduction to the Polytechnic campus, the Open Device Lab is a place for those looking for help with web development.  Students are able to seek guidance in the creation of mobile<br />
	applications, Java script utilities, webpage design, and other coding related projects.</p>
	
	<p>Originally founded as a grass-roots community movement, the goal of the Open Device Lab is to provide a facility to engage those working with internet-connected devices, and ultimately work<br />
	towards improving web applications on the whole.</p>
