	<h1>General Campus Information</h1>
	<p>One of the four main ASU locations found in Arizona, the Polytechnic Campus was originally founded in the Fall of 1996.  Constructed on land previously occupied by Williams Air Force Base, the<br />
	campus would open its doors that same year.  Today, the Polytechnic Campus is home to over 8,000 students studying in various technology-related fields.  Students within the many different<br />
	programs offered at the Polytechnic School are actively engaged in their fields of study, with research, software development, and more are taking place within on-campus facilities.
